this rhyme scheme is based in the rhyme detect build by kevin brwon et al. in https://github.com/kevin-brown/rhyme-detect

I optimized the rhyme detection (when use the function multiple times), and also i changed the algorithm that compute the scores, to support more cases (and to punish when a word is sufix of the other word).
